	    "5FDL": "time. It's gonna there there won't be any any bumps. All right, guys. So, my name is Amos Sire. Um I'm a software engineer. I've been building software for 23 years in a row non-stop. Um and (Wt) for the past 17 18 years of that, I've been an entrepreneur. You'll see more slides on that in a minute. Um what this master class is about it's about vibe coding or it's about using an AI agent (lH) in order to write code. Our friend explained vi coding is like going with your vibes. That's true. That's that's what Andre Karpati uh came up with with that famous tweet. But basically (am) um it is a new way of writing code. It's having like a sidekick, a pair programmer, uh being as intelligent as u as a PhD IQ and not feeling tired and and always be there for you and and know (Wv) the knowledge of the world. So it's a very very strong concept despite the fact that there are a lot of um memes negative memes around vibe coding like those who write code with vibe coding (ha) and they fail. Yes, that's true. But on the other side, 99% of the world is also writing code and they are not failing. So I'm going to try to give you that 99% of the perspective. But before I go on, (wz) I want to make sure that I tune my vocabulary to to you guys to to the audience in the room. By show of hands, who is a programmer? Okay. So I'm I'm looking at (KT) around 20% of people. Uh yeah. Uh right now around 20 25% of the room is a programmer. So those who s did not raise their hand and who are not a programmer can you please quickly raise your hand (il) and tell me what do you do? Yes please. Uh someone who writes code like who who writes code. Okay then uh my vocabulary was (XC) wrong. I need to tune my vocabulary then. Okay. So now like 90% of people Okay. That that puts me in a in a new zone. Like what is the difference between a programmer and a (NN) coder? Like anyone who didn't raise their hand in the first one saying like uh self-confidence. Okay. If you gain self-confidence then you call yourself a programmer. Okay. That's that's funny. (ET) All right. So I can uh use some technical jargon. Okay. um we will do this and and we have certain people who are going to follow this master class hands-on certain people who will watch (Hr) it. It's super fast. Therefore, uh we don't have like these rounds of trying it on your own uh so that we can deliver as much value as we can. If you fall behind in a step that I did and you c (Lh) you couldn't do or you you couldn't install a software that I installed, it's okay. Just leave it. Close your laptop. follow the conversations. Um, why did I call conversation? Because I (zG) want to keep it as much interactive as possible. Okay? Because whenever I prompt something, when I'm building this Chrome extension, I will talk about what we are building in just a minute. Uh, I (Ci) will keep it conversational. You guys will ask me questions and we'll keep it conversational. Why? Because we're going to run this for three hours in a row. Off of that three hour is gone. So, at (cy) 8:30, we will stop. There won't be any breaks in between, but you can take a break anytime you want because everything is recorded. So, you can uh you can go on with (pK) that. It's down. Okay, then let's run a backup here. This internet is also super slow, but uh let me quickly see if I can do something about it. Otherwise, then we (Qb) just stash. No, it is. It It's live, but it's only because the buffer is super slow. It can't upload. Let's Let's keep this in the background. Don't worry about that. But everything seems to be (ec) running fine. Like the microphone source every Yeah, let's I'm sorry for the online people that I have been chasing for the past 10 days that join online, join online. But now those guys (Ke) um yeah, go back to the YouTube uh channel, the main channel. There might be another live URL created. All right. So before I start, there's one more. I I'm too itchic for (Da) this workshop. Sorry about that. Uh what I want to do is see if this thing works because I don't want you guys to stay behind. Um yep, it works. Somebody (Yd) is sending me those vibes. It's not me. Thank you. Stop it, please. If if you go to this website uh called vibstage uh.amlire.com, you'll see a um you will (eo) see a QR code coming along and then whenever you do some of these things on your phone and then you see things happening on my screen. So, so we can kind of like share these vibes um while (my) doing vibe coding. Okay. All right. And and the the funny thing is that when I code, it also comes on the top of my code base. So So we're gonna have a lot of fun. All right. So something about (Ch)"
      },
      {
      "gd0j": "of fun. All right. So something about (Ch) me. Um as I said, I have been coding for 23 years. 17 years of that. Uh full stack engineer. Seven years um doing mostly AI applications. For the past two and a half years, I've been uh building (sE) uh AI agents. And if you put that in perspective of full stack development that's like 20 years in total. I speak five human languages around 20 computer languages and also a lot of uh (wj) management lingo. So you can talk to me in management lingo because I've_been building companies in the past 10 years. I built five companies in total. Uh two agencies, three startups. Um one of my (II) last startup was through this company that I worked for as a consultant. Uh it was a pretty big company called Zap. Um on this these logos that you can see um $300 million uh scale up. I was director (tG) of engineering. I made some profits. I brought those profits to my startup uh which is an AI agent or was an AI agent and oh thank you. Yeah lovely. Thank you. Um so this uh my knowledge from the (Ag) past two and a half years of building AI agents comes from this startup and then after that consulting. So basically um this was a voice AI agent where I built um a very cool thing. I'll demo it in (dR) just a minute if the tech allows me. We were building this uh old school I'm not going to ask who knows this picture. Who knows this picture? Let me see. Okay, you guys are (rV) older than 40 years old because this is a 1980s series, a TV series. Alander, how do you know it? You're not 40. Okay, you know this picture. So, so this is a talking car. It's a science fiction in (TA) 1980s. David Assholov talks to this car and I was building this software that uh would do talking car software basically. And feel free to give me vibes anytime. Uh so I can also give myself some vibes (Gv) here. Um, so we were building the software, we we kind of like pivoted towards this Samanta from the 2013 uh movie where you have a talking AI agent companion that talks to you and then (Fe) wherever you go it it is with you and we're building that. Um but unfortunately like through all of those hypes that we had during those times uh of I really missed those times on uh of (tw) my my entrepreneurship uh which which was really cool. I I brought a lot of my savings from my my uh my agency and my freelancing career and I lost all of that. But unfortunately after the (qq) liquidation I got a new uh uh perspective especially the experience when we were building the software the experience I got through that voice layer through the automation layer where (aV) we use NA10 which we'll do today a lot um that is a great asset to me that um that I didn't lose. Um now what I'm doing is I'm I'm switching from literally for from the past six months (Wm) or four months I'm switching from this founder mode to educator mode. Um I started a YouTube channel. It's growing and I'm putting a lot of content and I'm doing uh monthly workshops. U I'm (JL) showing exactly the same software that I built uh in my startup. Now I I show to the world how I do it and I build it in public. So that means like I put everything online as I go. It's a series (Vf) of workshops. Uh the first one will happen on 15th of March. It's 100% free and I will keep my uh my workshops for free. Hopefully I'll I'll keep finding um (Wx) sponsors which is a little bit hard and it's super sad to say after this internet problem that we had too much negative vibes of finding like for 500 euros of a sponsorship to buy you guys (Mh) just uh some pizza and some drinks. It's very hard. like we it's a very sad story like we need more people to take risks. Um and what we're building in these workshops is this one AI agent. It's (cF) called Samanta. Um it's a hands-free voice agent. You learn how to build this uh and it works like this. You you go hands on uh sorry handsree um and you're biking, you're driving, whenever you're (od) in need of talking to your companion, you just give a a phone call. Hi. Hey Mel, how are you doing? I'm doing good. Um Samantha, I have a quick question. Um I'm right now trying to (CN) give um a workshop uh at 42 Berlin. It's a coding school. Um and I just discovered there is a problem with internet. Can you tell me a joke and put internet in the context? (Or) Absolutely. Here's a joke you can use for your workshop and the internet situation. Why did the computer go to therapy at 42? Because every time it tried to (KE) connect to the internet, it lost it sense of connection. And you could ask so so it's basically um and my storage is full. That means no online content for this (AB) workshop because of internet. Can you check if uh Riverside is now back? Life is back. Or maybe I can check it myself. This is so sad. I did a lot of (LT)""
      },
      {
      "hR2a": "This is so sad. I did a lot of (LT) preparation for this. There is a No, there's It's working. Look, look. Yeah, it's working. Perfect. So, you guys get some recordings. Anyways, it's going to be low quality recording because live (xU) stream, but my backup uh didn't work. Anyways, so what I just showed you is is just a phone number. Behind that there is a chat GPT. Behind that there is a (yW) workflow on NA10 and I teach that on a monthly basis. Every month a new topic and and I think this combination of these three things is really really p powerful. Um I don't just teach it by (Zo) coming here and then teaching it. I go and lock myself in a corking space. I have two corking space memberships in either of them. And usually on a Sunday um because I'm married, I have two kids. (GA) Um I during the the week I'm super busy with running errands. And I record these really detailed series like this is the first series that I recorded for 15th of March where you get byite-size tutorials (dr) 5 minutes each and then you basically go and and build um that voice agent that you're you're supposed to build. And when I do these workshops, it's pretty much recorded with multiple cameras and (ub) the screen recording really high quality high quality voice so that you guys get extremely good material for playback uh at home and then following the tutorials. Um the last one that we did (JZ) on 17th of May went viral. Uh se 470 people registered. we had to like be careful on how to um pick the 120 so that we have not overflowed and it went very nice. Um and what we are doing is (QE) we're basically focusing entirely on this NA10 workflows vibe coding and building AI agents. That's basically the three corners of the content that I'm creating. This is another playlist uh (Ro) also building voice AI agents that you can follow on the internet. And then this is a playlist where you can follow to learn vibe coding. So literally the gist of uh what we are going to do here (ad) uh is in that um course voding 101 crash course. Actually this um courses based on my personal workflows in this thing that I am showing you is a a project um that we build in this course. Um it's an (Bb) early version of that but it's like literally two three weeks old but we already got a a new version which is a desktop one which I also stream on my YouTube channel so you guys can follow (zg) that how cool vibe coding is like I didn't know anything about objective C++ I've never written objective C++ and this is right now using objective C++ to mount this all these emojis on top of (HR) these screens it's really high complex software and this is built using V coding Um so since you guys are programmers I'd like to talk a little bit about this (fR) this program that I I'm running in my workshops called AI champions. Uh please reach out to me if you want to become a champion an AI champion. It's a program that you sign up for a week before the (ek) workshop happening. The next workshop is going to happen on 21st of uh June. So a week before you join the program we go on a long call three hours four hours long call. I teach you everything. I I (SG) teach all the champions everything about uh the content of the workshop and then you are the the captain of one table. So a table may have like eight people and then you're kind of like unblocking (Xw) those people when they are blocked. Um the most interesting part about these workshops is that we have a lot of fun. Uh it's not three hours, it's like the whole day and and (hz) it's moderated by um a dear friend of mine, Rakkesh, who's a coach and who takes like everyone and then make sure that the vibes are up and and we that's that's Rakkesh actually. Um and and we (th) make sure that you get a lot out of it and and it is free. I'm I'm planning to keep it free for throughout the year at least and we keep building the same software again and keep adding it a new (EN) uh skill set to to this series. Um I would like to say a few words about our sponsors. Uh they bought you guys pizza. So if you like pizza, say thank you to them. (bm) Um so so trust you um is a company that is an AI first um hospitality platform. Um they have these three departments uh CXP AI powered review feedback analytics. So they go and take feedback (oI) of hotels from all over the internet and then show them on the on the dashboards for hotel managers to do that. CDP a unified data for targeted personalized marketing. So usually uh people when (xA) they go and check in in different hotels they have different systems different software systems. So the CDP component of their software is kind of like unifying all that data. The customer (Qz) data platform is making sure that um hotels can see their guests as one profile not so many profiles using so many different emails and so on and then make intelligent decision- making on (gI)"
      },
      {
      "o1Bq": "make intelligent decision- making on (gI) that and especially intelligent marketing. That's the most important part. And when it comes to uh AI agents, um this is a component of the software that basically is a front-facing (II) customerf facing AI agent that uses data from CDP or other sources and u provide a kind of more chat GPT looking like and also it may change forms from text to voice to others as they grow. cool (IU) company. I trust u trust you. So, uh they're already hiring um a few companies. They're not a startup. They're a 17 uh years old company. Um super secure runway wise, revenue-wise, (rv) uh cool company to work with. Um if you're looking for a job, they are already hiring and you can find it from this presentation. And you already know where to find the presentation from (pV) amalire.com/vitecoding and these slides are there. Uh and you can also connect uh with uh Malvika Madok if I pronounce that name correctly. Um she's the acquisition manager and that's the cure (Mu) code you can scan here. And a special thank you for 42 Berlin despite the Wi-Fi problem. uh because without this room, without this um this level of uh support that we got from M42 BIN, this (yZ) wouldn't be possible. Thank you so much uh everyone involved here, Nora, Vanessa, and everyone. Janna, thank you so much for managing this. Uh this was not possible without this space, and I (iN) think we're going to have a lot of fun. Where are the vibes, guys? Come on, give me some vibes. to your coding. All right. So, uh the workshop that's happening next is (XA) going to be on 11th of June. Um this is the QR code where you can join. This is pure NA10 workshop. What we're going to do here uh is pure VIP coding. That one will be pure um (pz) NA10 and then the next one is happening on 21st of June and that will be pure both of them combined building Vanessa Vanessa sorry Samanta Vanessa is in the crowd sorry yeah we well you can call (Lj) your AI agent Vanessa if you want um but Vanessa is also a beautiful name I I will rename my contact name to Vanessa if that's fine So we have the 21st one. This is (ZQ) very interesting because our AI agent uhfrom 15th of March and from 17th of May already have the following uh capacity. It has a uh access to Google Docs. It has access to your Gmail inbox. It can (kK) read emails. It can compose emails. Those two days are already recorded. You will not miss those two parts. This is part three. Um so before joining 21st of June I highly encourage you to go on my (Wr) YouTube channel and consume the the 15th of March and 27th of uh I mean 17th of May those two workshops part one part two so you can catch up with part three very well what we're going to add in (eO) part three is perplexity so it can search the internet you can call almost save Vanessa you can call Samantha and then you say hey Samantha what's happening in Berlin in one hour it will (bd) go to perplexity find the uh recent activities happening in Berlin and tell you that oh there is a party happening at Beach Meta Berlin and there is a meetup happening at CIC and ethos AI (Uk) builders cool guys um they're moderating anyways I just shamelessly did my promotion I'm also the AI builders moderator I'm uh I'm managing that meetup as well it's happening I think in (cM) 28th of March I don't have a a QR code for that and that's the group for this particular uh workshop. I encourage you if you want to continue um with your (EK) laptops to join this group because then I send certain keys like an API key that if you don't have a credit card to to buy it I can give you mine you can use it for this workshop and so on. So I'll (Rs) keep that and then we'll start our hands on before that any questions. Okay, Janna, can you see how many people joined in the WhatsApp group? Um, yes. Yes. (sz) Yeah, it's two different things. NA10 is more like low code. Uh, no code lang flow is more I I didn't try extensively lang flow as much as NA10. Um, oh, I'm I'm sorry. Okay, I'm totally um messing (DB) it out with lang chain and lang graph. So lang flow I don't know lang flow. I don't know lang flow. Okay. Okay. So it's it's more probably like uh like n10. I don't know it but n is is old. (oE) It's it's really baked up. Uh there are a lot of these uh automation platforms but I don't know. And this is that vibe stage thingy. Okay. So please um continue sending me these emojis. Even (Un) if you are bored, send me those boring emojis so that I know and I can change something. It's an interactive workshop. Okay, these emojis are from me. Okay, this is this is not that you guys are (Vt) bored, right? We're just starting. All righty. Okay, let's start. Um I am just about to start, but that she Yeah, this last you guys by show of hands, who's the student in this room? (sg)"
